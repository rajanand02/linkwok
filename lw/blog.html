              <h2>RACING TOWARDS TRACTION</h2>
              <div class="cropped_blog_image">
              <img src="img/blog4.jpg" alt="">
              </div>
              
            </div>
            <div class="blog-body">
             <p>There are several reasons that a Nissan GT-R is exactly twice as fast as an Aston Martin Vantage, despite having exactly half the number of cylinders, engine size, and overall price tag. And one of those reasons is that it is that it puts all 4 wheels to work, as opposed to the Vantage’s rear 2. The other is that it has an awesome moniker- Godzilla.</p>

            <p>We’re only here to talk about the former. Traction is simply the number of unique users who’ve stopped by For a tech startup, this seems to mean much more than cylinders, torque, power, leather upholstery, music system and cute picnic tables for the rear seats all put together! It makes sense, dont get me wrong- creating an elaborate product without customer validation is anathema to the future of any startup. </p>

            <p>More importantly, it forces the startup to shift focus from turning a neat idea to a product, into entirely virgin territory- turning the product into a business. And with this achieved, the startup moves one step closer into becoming a company. In any case, what use is a great product that nobody uses?</p>

            <p>That doesn’t make it any easier though- our budget for marketing the product is exactly…zero. Which essentially means that whatever we spend on that is going to have been scavenged from somewhere else. Which also essentially means that the founders and the team who have been hermetically sealed within an enclosed space thrashing away at keyboards and split screens must actually venture out into the world to really communicate with people! And boy, does Linkwok need some explaining!! </p>

            <p>So in preparation for the big move outdoors, we’ve stuck indoors one last quick time- polishing off the front page, making sure the featured maps are easy to load, the app is stable and light on its feet, uploading the mini-tutorials and buying new shoes. Not in that order.</p>

            <p>If you’re reading this, wish us luck…</p>

            <div class="blog-body">
             <p>So lets start off with the big news!</p>

            <p>LINKWOK IS LIVE! &lt;insert Frankenstein sound clip ‘its alive!’&gt;The video is up on Youtube and sailing along at a rapid clip and so far, smooth going.</p>

            <p>Well, not really- just last night we hit a major speed bump in moving our system from one server to the next. Luckily we cleaned it up before anyone noticed our mess. That, I guess is the advantage of being a startup- when traction hasn’t yet picked up, nobody sees the screwups (trees falling in forests and all that). So as far as the majority of people are concerned, the product came out baked to golden perfection.</p>

            <p>So we hit Bangalore, India this weekend, planning on attending the Unplugged conference that we wanted to pitch at (our application got rejected, which I now think is a boon in disguise). The previous day, we sneaked into the Microsoft Ventures accelerator graduation and I realised something. In fact, something relatively common in the startup community- the side job proved to be more interesting than the main show.</p>

            <p>A friend, who was part of the program was pitching and we decided to come over and support him, but what we gained was a quality introduction to several VCs and angels. And boy did we get tough questions flung at us! One flung Linkwok down as a glorified mindmap, another as a visual search engine, no different than the carcasses of so many over the last year.</p>

            <p>What has come out however is a strengthening of conviction, and a need to improve our pitch. Linkwok, by dint of its qualities is not easy to explain to anybody, let alone in a few minutes of back and forth questioning.</p>

            <p>Which is why I’ve come to the realization that at the moment, we dont focus on discussing the ‘searching for searchmaps’ feature. We need one point to pin the other party on- that <b>Linkwok is a decision engine.</b> It is <b>your favourite search engines, re-imagined around you. </b>You do not depend on automation to give you the best results- you take control of creating your flow of information to make your point, to arrive at your decision. Thats what we mean by the tagline <b>‘search just got personal‘</b> and we need to articulate it well. </p>

              <h2>THE HUNT FOR A MASCOT</h2>
              <div class="cropped_blog_image">

              <p>
                In our endeavour to create a great promotional video, the inevitable question ambles over and taps you on your knee- hey what about a mascot? And its an easy question to say ‘yes’ to- all around us, we’re surrounded by successful mascots: Snoopy for Metlife, the Geico gecko, the Michelin Man, the Pillsbury doughboy, the Mailchimp monkey, and many many more! And they stick because their personality reminds us of the exact quality the brand is aiming for. Thats huge! And I guess that doesn’t come across from Day 1, when we haven’t even gone live yet…
              </p>
              <p>
                But there comes a point when you’re crafting a product, and you think its a great product, and obviously everybody will love it, and obviously everybody will tell their friends about it, and obviously a super mascot helps make this entire thing more viral. So why not?
              </p>
              <p>
               The desire itches away, even though in the back of my head I know that it is far too early to create one. We have somewhat of an idea of who our early evangelist users (EEU) will be, but no concrete data. Hell we may be completely mistaken and realise that our EEUs will be travel agents, instead of students and young professionals as we imagine right now!
              </p>
              <p>
              Knowing full well that this is a ridiculous proposition, here is my first sketch for a mascot, keeping just a few pointers in mind while making one:<br>
              - It should be related to the word ‘Wok’ (the large stir fry pan on the kid’s head)<br>
              - It should be cute<br>
              - It should be easily animatable<br>
              - It should be attractive to our target EEUs<br>
              - It should stand for something (in this case, ease of use)<br>
              </p>

            The overall structure of the project completed, we are a whisper away from what we believe the user experience should be. Or at least, we believe we are. At this point, with limited customer feedback, its difficult to ascertain for sure.Functionally, the RIA seems to be performing stunningly, but there is still the stress testing feedback to be awaited.

            In any case, this blog post is not so much about an update on development as a place to cook out thoughts on managing Cybit. We are currently understaffed and working on two projects- that however much we decry are not side by side, taking the same limited set of resources to build. 
          </p>

            Why you ask? Because as an entrepreneur, it is nigh impossible to let a good idea pass you by, and in this age of multi bambojillion buyouts and IPOs, the vague notion creeps on over your shoulder that you may be passing over your breadbasket and focusing on a dud instead.
          </p>
          <p>
          My opinion about the tech bubble (or whether indeed there is a tech bubble) is that we’re looking at it all wrong. A bubble isn’t simply about how much money is flung at a particular segment of the market. It is about how attractive the market is, how talked about it is, how many newcomers it attracts and how minutely each and every move by its heavy weights is watched. And by that regard, we are currently in the midst of an ever expanding tech bubble. The truth is simply that when so many tools are available to so many people, and the spirit of entrepreneurship is lauded as heroism, why wouldn’t there be a bubble?
